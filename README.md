<h1>NIST RMF - RMF Catergorization (Using SP 800-60, Vol II)</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I will go over Risk Management Framework (RMF). I demonstrated a step- by step guide on how information systems are categorized into Low, Moderate or High impact levels using FIPS-199 and SP 800-60 Vol II as guides. 
<br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Microsoft worksheet</b> 


<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>MacOS</b>

First I went to the NIST website to find the SP 800-60m Vol II document: <br/>

<br />
<br />
 Found it! Now I proceeded to download the document (I believe it's best to download it just in case something happens on the website and you can't obtain it when needed) :  <br/>

<br />
I'll start looking at the system description and identify the information types (the words underlined in bold). On the job I know I would sit with the System Owner in a meeting, the SO knows everything a system should be doing: <br/>

<br />
Now we can use the NIST SP 800-60 Vol II guide for the information types to understand their provisional security categorization along with the security impact levels for the security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and availability!

<br />
<br />
I will then enter the justifications for the security categorizations and the security impact levels into a worksheet document, this process will be for each information type (Services Acquisition Information Type, Proposal Development Information Type, Reporting Information Type):

 <br />
<br />
Then I used FIPS 199 guide to help me format the security categorization of the information types:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Once the information type security impact levels are finalized, the system security categorization is determined by adopting the “high water mark” of information types impact determinations for the security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
